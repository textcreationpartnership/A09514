            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>About that time, there was a famous and reformed monaſtery of FRANCIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CANS in the prouince of S.

            <p>This miracle was not vnlike to that, when the riuer of Iordane ſtood ſtill for the Children of ISRAEL to paſs;
<pb facs="tcp:14984:12"/>or when S. PETER walked vpon the waues of the ſea: and indeed, it was no ſmall beginninge of God almighties many fauours, exhibited to this bleſſed Saint.</p>
            <p>This obſtacle beinge remoued, he paſſed the other part of his way, (the holy Ghoſt beinge his guide) without any difficultie, and at length ariued to his deſired harbour, this ſolitarie mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, ſituated amongſt great rocks, which they comonly call <hi>Los Manxere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> where he came to the Fathers, and asked the habit of S.

            <p>BVT to deſcend to particulars, wherin his religious ſimplicitie was manifeſted. He was ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorped in God almightie, that he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothinge of exteriour thinges. When he was a younge brother kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge the keyes of the pauntrie, for the ſpace of ſix months, there was in the pauntrie grapes and pomgranades, which lay ſo palpably, that none could chooſe but ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he for that ſpace neither ſawe, nor ſmelt, much leſſe touched them: beinge asked why he did not giue them vnto the brothers, he humbly anſwered, that he knewe of none that were there. An other time, liuinge fower yeares in an other cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he neuer tooke notice of a great tree which ſtood in the middeſt of the court, which was obuious to euery ones eie. Being a yeare in an other place, and asked what his cell was made of, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb facs="tcp:14984:16"/>he knew not whether it was of ſtone, or brick, or vvood. And a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vvhich he frequented aboue others, yet he knevve neither ſituation, forme, or any ornament vvhich did belonge thervnto. He vvas vvont to ſay to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed THERESIA his ghoſtly child, that he knevve neuer a brother in his monaſterie, but only by his ſpeech. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer he vvas ſo mortified in his eies, that vvhere ſoeuer he vvas, he knevve no difference in places, no diſtance of cells, and finally he vvas a dead man to all exteriour thinges. Neither vvas this mortification any ſtupiditie of nature, or vvant of ſenſes, but his continuall bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyinge his thoughts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God almighty, a more noble, and higher obiect. Who could but thinke this chaſt child of S.

He kept ſuch a continuall guard ouer his eies, that he neuer knevve any vvoman by her face. There vvas a certaine noble matron famous for her vertue, vvho vvas vvont at PLACENTIA, ſome times to viſite the holy Father, for his
<pb facs="tcp:14984:17"/>ſpirituall counſell she meetinge him at ABVLA, ſaluted him, and expreſſed to him the difficulties of her ſtate, he modeſtly denied, that he euer ſavve the vvoman. If euer he opened his eies, it vvas in the quire, though he had ſo good a memory, that he knevve moſt part of the office vvithout booke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge Superiour he did particularly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this imperfection vvith ſeueritie.

            <p>He did vvare for ſeauen yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a haire shirt full of hard knotts, S. THERESIA affirmeth that he vvore it tvventie yeares.</p>
            <p>Beſides plates of Iron, and other things vvhervvith he tyranized euer his tender flesh. His diſciplines vvere ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and bloodie, that he ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the trunke of a tree then a humaine bodie. He vvould neuer couer his head although it rayned neuer ſo faſt, or the
<pb facs="tcp:14984:18"/>ſun shined neuer ſo hott. His diet was ſo ſlender, and meane, that in his youth, and old age he did eate nothinge but browne bread, and the moſt muſtie cruſts that he could finde. If ſometimes he recreated himſelfe with a fewe boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hearbes, he would not be ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to eate them with oyle. Beinge ſuperiour he cauſed as many beanes and peaſe to be boyled at once, as should ſerue the conuent for ſeauen dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which auſteritie his ſubiects moſt willingly embraced, beinge glad in ſome meaſure to immitate their cheife. But he ſeaſoned his owne portion with ashes, or ſome vngratefull liquour, leaſt his pallate should take pleaſure in his meate.</p>
            <p>Mother THERESIA hath heard his companions ſay, that ſome times he liued eight dayes together without any meate or drinke, eſpecially when with more violence, he addicted himſelfe to deuotion. For he ſuffered in his prayers frequent raptes and extaſies, of which (ſaith she) I am wittneſſe. He neuer dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke wine but water, though for the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his ſtomach it was preſcribed to him by the Phiſitian: but he conſtantly refuſed it ſayinge that nothinge was ſo

<pb facs="tcp:14984:19"/>gaue in great meaſure to this holy man, vvhich I ſpeake of, to continue</hi> 47. <hi>yeares together in ſuch austere penance, as all knovve.

<pb facs="tcp:14984:19"/>of the ſame vpon it, he told me that vvhen it vvas very cold he did putt it of, and opened the dore and little vvindovve of his cell, that aftervvard vvhen he did putt his cloke on againe, and shutt his dore, he might giue ſome contentment and recreat his bodie, vvhich before vvas frozen vvith cold: He did very ordinarily eate but once in three dayes; and he asked me at vvhat I maruailed, for it vvas verie poſsible, for one that accuſtomed himſelfe to it. His pouerty vvas extreame, and likevviſe his mortification in his youth, &amp;c. VVith all his ſanctitie he vvas verie affable, though he vſed not many vvordes, if he vvere not ſpoken too, for then he vvas verie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge, hauinge a good vnderſtandinge.</hi> And a little after. <hi>His end vvas like his life preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge and admonishinge his Fryars.

Since our Lord hath let me enioy him more then in his life, giuinge me aduiſe and counſell in many thinges I haue ſeene him many times in exceedinge great glorie; the firſt time he appeared vnto me, he ſaied:</hi> O happie pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which did merit ſuch a reward! <hi>and many other thinges. A yeare before he died, he appeared to me beinge abſent, and I knevve that he should dye, and I ſent him vvord beinge ſome leagues

Behold here his auſteritie endeth vvith ſo great glorie, he ſeemed to comfort me more novve, then vvhen he vvas in this vvorld. Our Lord told me once, that nothinge should be asked in his name, vvhich he vvould not heare.

            <p>THE man of God increaſinge in his rigorous penance, did not only mortifie in part, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued his paſſions, and made his ſenſes ſubordinate to the rule of reaſon, he ſuffered nothinge to enter into his ſoule, which might ſeparate, or in the leaſt kinde withdrawe his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his beloued ſpouſe, for (as much as was poſſible for pilgrime man) he enioyed the ſpirit of God; golden peace and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine conſolation ſatt vpon his winges of contemplation, and where others make their bodies maſters, he made his a ſlaue vnto his ſpirit. Hence it came to paſs, that many of both ſexe, drawne with the fragra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t odour of his vertues, flocked to him, as to an other Apoſtle, to whoſe counſells and admonitions they obeyed, as to a diuine oracle.</p>
            <p>Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a time the count ORAPSANE a deuout nobleman, came to viſit him.
<pb facs="tcp:14984:21"/>And fallinge into diſcourſe, how much God almightie was moued with the ſins of the world, out of his zeale breaketh into theſe ſpeeches. O Father! what doe you thinke? what will be come of this wicked world? doe you thinke the diuine iuſtice, can conteine it ſelfe any longer from reuenge? behold howe vertue is oppreſſed, and ſin triumpheth? how wilfully doe we hoarde vp anger againſt the day of anger? to which the man of God modeſtly anſwered and ſayed, noble Sir. doe not afflict your ſelfe, a remedy will eaſily be found to cure this diſeaſe, the point of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie conſiſteth only in you and me, for the generall perdition of mankinde, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth from this fountaine, that all and euery one diſſemblinge or cloakinge their owne ſins, accuſe the wholl, when the wholl can not be ſaid to ſin at all, but particular perſons in the wholl. Wherfore men crye out againſt the wickedneſſe of the word, that all are naught, and none that doe good, when if they would but looke into their owne particular, they should finde matter enough of ſorrowe, and to moue them ſelues to doe penance for their owne faults: but nowe becauſe they blame the
<pb facs="tcp:14984:22"/>wholl, they neglect their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares, and iuſtifie themſelues with a ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish preſumption.

At which deniall the Emperour beinge a little moued, with anger, ſaied, we charge you, Father, that you would take care of our ſoule. He ſeeinge this ſuddaine alteration of CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR, fell downe at the feete of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and earneſtly deſired him, to differre the buſines to what day or houre he would pleaſe to appoint, that in the meane time he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend it to God almighty; which the Emperour graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then he tooke his leaue of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,

Why should my eares be troubled with the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes of courtiers, who came to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke my fault in religion? I confeſs that this office may be exerciſed without ſinne, but whether it be expedient for my ſoule, ſweet IESVS, tell me? and when he entred into his cell. Lord, I beſeech thee pull me not from hence, whether thy omnipotent hand hath brought me. Here I am ſafe, here I am rich; becauſe I enioy thee who

            <p>And what candide ſynceritie he vſed, in contemninge proferred honours, men of no ſmall qualitie obſerued, that thoſe who honoured him, he would no more regard their ſpeech then a ſimple ideot, and would labour to diuert them from that, to ſome other diſcourſe.

            <p>GOD almightie was alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him, and he with God. His ſoule was like a fyerie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, made hott with the fuell of the croſſe of CHRIST. It was not in his owne power, to conteine himſelfe, but what thinge ſoeuer he either ſawe, or heard, which might delight his beloued IESVS, though it were but a farr of, his heart-ſtringes would beginne to tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, and his vitall ſpirits leaue him, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall into extaſie. He was accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed for a wholl houre together, to ſay his prayers with his armes ſtretched out in manner of a croſſe, ſightinge and weepinge, till at laſt he would be beſides himſelfe, eleuated from the ground, and vnited only to his God. He was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in this manner rapt, when he was in the quire at mattins. But his deuotion was much more augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted at the aulter, when he celebrated the dreadfull ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb facs="tcp:14984:24"/>then would riuers of teares gush in aboundance from his venerable eies, that would moue the moſt ſtonie and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart of any of the ſtanders by, vnto compunction. After maſſe he would withdrawe himſelfe into his cell, where he hath beene often heard to haue had greuious conflicts with deuils: who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes appearinge in a viſible shape, would followe him vp and downe with a terrible furie.</p>
            <p>In talkinge of God almightie, his ſoule would be preſently inebriated with diuine ſweetnes, and aſcendinge by degrees from one word to an other, as, what was God incarnated for me? was God made man for me? was God veſted with humane flesh for me? and the like. He would forthwith breake into excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and hurryinge himſelfe into his cell, would for the ſpace of aboue three howers together, looſe the vſe of his ſenſes.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Marianut in vita B.

               <head>A letter of the bleſſed Father <hi>FR. PETER DE AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CANTARA,</hi> to the holy Mother <hi>THERESA OF IESVS,</hi> who demanded his counſell, whither ſhe ſhould founde her Monaſteries with rents or no.</head>
               <p>THE holy Ghoſt giue you his grace and loue, &amp;c. I receiued yours, deliuered me by DON GONZALES D'ARANDA. And am amazed, conſideringe your zeale, and pietie: in committinge to the direction of learned lavvyers, that vvhich is no vvayes their profeſſion, or belonginge vnto them: you should doe vvell to take their aduice concerninge the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of a proceſs or of ſutes in lavv, and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall affaires, but in that vvhich concerns perfection of life, vve ought to treate only vvith thoſe vvho practiſe the ſame. For ſuch as the conſcience of euerie one is, ſuch are his exerciſes and
<pb facs="tcp:14984:28"/>vvorkes. Concerninge the Euangelicall counſells, may I demand vvhither they be obſeruable or noe? For that the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of God cannot be but good, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the obſeruance therof ſeeme difficult, vnleſs to thoſe, vvho gouerne themſelues accordinge to humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hauinge leſs confidence in God then they ought. For he, vvho hath giuen the counſell, vvill conſequently giue force and meanes to accomplish the ſame. And if your zeale and feruour dravve you to embrace the counſells of CHRIST IESVS, obſerue them vvith the greateſt integritie, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that poſſible you can: ſeeinge they were equally giuen to both ſexes. It can not be, but the ſame meritt and reward will be rendered vnto you, as to others that haue truly obſerued them. And if there be ſeene any want or neceſſitie in the Monaſteries of poore Religious Women, it is becauſe they are poore againſt their wills, and not through faulte of their vowe of pouertie, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowinge of the Euangelicall counſells. For I accoumpt not much of their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pouertie, but of their patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſame for the loue of God. But I more eſteeme of that pouertie
<pb facs="tcp:14984:29"/>which is deſired, procured, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the ſame loue. And if I should thinke or otherwiſe determinatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, I should not hould my ſelfe a good Catholique. I beleeue in this, and in all other thinges taught by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour, and that his counſells are good and profitable, as proceedinge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and though they oblige not to ſinne, they binde neuertheleſs that man to be more perfect that followeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then if he had not vndertaken them at all. I hold them poore in ſpirit, which are poore in will, as our Sauiour hath ſaied, and my ſelfe proued; how be it I beleeue more from God the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of myne owne experience, that thoſe, who by the grace of God, are with all their hearts poore, leade a life moſt happie as confidinge and hoping in him alone. His diuine Maieſtie giue you light to vnderſtand this truth, and to practiſe the ſame. Beleeue not thoſe that shall tell you the contrarie, for want of light and vnderſtandinge, or for not hauinge taſted, how ſweet our Lord is to thoſe, that feare and loue him, renouncinge for his sake all vnneceſſarie thinges of this world, for they are enemies of the Croſſe of CHRIST, not beleeuinge
<pb facs="tcp:14984:29"/>the glorie which acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panieth the ſame. I alſo pray our Lord to giue you this light, that you be not wantinge in the beleife of this truth, ſo much manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. And that you take not counſell, but of the followers of CHRIST IESVS. Although others thinke it ſufficient if they obſerue the thinges they are bound vnto, yet they haue not alwayes greater vertue and perfection by their worke. And though the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell bee good, yet that of our bleſſed Sauiour is much better. Who knowes what he counſelleth and giueth grace to accomplish the ſame: and in the end reward to thoſe who hope in him and not in rents and goods of the earth.</p>

But after his three yeares expired, he betooke himſelfe againe to his poore heremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, where he fatted his ſoule with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred contemplation, perſeueringe in readinge the ancient Fathers, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, faſtinges, and regulare diſcipline. But the more he hid himſelfe in theſe obſcure places, the more the fame of his learninge and ſainctitie did shine abroade. And in teſtimonie that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie would not haue this reſplenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t light, to be put vnder a bushell, but to

He fell ſick in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of S. ANDREVVE DE MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TE ARENO, where God almightie vouchſafed to let him knowe the hower of his death.

               <p>I call S. BONAVENTVRE to witneſſe what I ſay:<note place="margin">Bonau. in the Med. of the life of Christ cap. <hi>73.</hi>
                  </note> his wordes are theſe. The ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue of prayer is able to obtaine all good, and remoue all hurtfull things. If thou will patiently endure aduerſity; bee a man of prayer: If thou wilt ouercome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, bee a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayer: If thou wilt tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy peruerſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; bee a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayer: If thou wilt knowe the deceiptes of Sathan, and auoid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; bee a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayer. If thou wilt liue ioyfully in the worke of God, and trace the way of labour and affliction; bee a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayer.

For the Confirmation of all which, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Teſtimonie of holy Scriptures, let this bee an euident proofe vnto the, that by dayly experience, wee heare and ſee il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate and ſimple perſons, to haue attained the foreſayd and greater thinges by the vertue of prayer.

               <p>I beceech you, can there bee found a richer treaſure or a more fertile fielde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired? Heare an other Doctour no leſſe for Religion and ſanctitye, who vpon the ſame matter ſayth: By prayer the ſoule is cleanſed from ſinne, replenished with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, confirmed in fayth, roborated in, and refreshed in Spirit. Prayer eſtabiliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth the inward man, pacifieth the heart, knoweth the trueth, conquereth tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, expelleth ſorrowe, reneweth the ſences, ſtirreth vp languishing vertue, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to flight tepidity, and skoureth the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14984:43"/>ruſt of vices. In prayer the quicke ſparkles of celeſtial deſires are inceſſantly ſent forth from the burning coales of diuine loue. The priuiledges of prayer are rare, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues admirable. Prayer vnlocketh the gates of Heauen, manifeſteth diuine ſecrets and alwaies findeth free acceſſe to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of God.

               <p>HAVINGE take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notice of the vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of prayer and meditation, wee will nowe declare the matter about which meditation is to bee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: for ſeeing it is ordained to this end, that the ſoule of him that meditateth, may bee excited to the feare and loue of God, and the keeping of his commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: the matter of meditation ought to bee ſuch, as doth next diſpoſe to this end and ſcope. And although euery creature, and the whole Scripture it ſelfe bee able to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14984:43"/>this matter vnto vs, yet ſpeaking ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the miſteries of our holy fayth, contained in the <hi>Creed,</hi> are moſt efficacious and profitable to attaine vnto this end. For theſe on the one ſide, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties benefittes, the later iudgement, the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hell, and the glorie of Paradiſe; all which, like sharpe prickes doe ſpurre vs on to the loue and feare of God: On the other ſide, they comprehende the life and Paſſion of our Lord and Sauiour, which is the ſpringe and fountaine of all our good. Theſe two thinges contained in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall <hi>Creed,</hi> for the moſt part yeilde matter of meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therfore I thinke prayer and meditation ought chiefly to be conuerſant about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although euery one in particular may haue certaine pointes, which may more ſpecially inflame and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the ſoule to the loue and feare of God.</p>
               <p>Beeing therfore perſwaded with this reaſon, that I might the better conduct younge beginners, and vntrained ſoldiars into this way of mentall prayer, and that I might giue vnto them altogether prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and (as it were to litle children) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chowed matter of meditation, I haue ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted two kindes of meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, almoſt take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the miſteries of our faith, the one ſeruing for the morning, the other for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14984:44"/>euening: that as the body is comonly fedd with two meales; ſoe the ſoule may be ſtrenthened and nourished with two ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual refections, by the meditation and conſideration of heauenly things. Some of theſe are of the Paſſion and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, others of the miſteries of our fayth, as I ſayd befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; But thoſe who can not haue the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to meditate twice a day, after this manner, they may vſe them, to wit; they may take to their conſideration the 7. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Meditations in the one weeke, and the latter in an other weeke; or they may chiefly inſiſt vpon thoſe of the life and Paſſion of our Sauiour: although the other be not to be neglected, eſpecially in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of a ſoules conuerſion, to whom they are proper, when the feare of God, contrition and horrour of ſinne, is chiefly to be regarded and ſought after.</p>

                     <p>THis day thou shalt call to memory thy ſinnes, and shalt exerciſe thy ſelfe in the knowledge of thy ſelfe, that on the one ſide, thou maieſt truly ponder the greatneſſe of thy offences, and on the other ſide, thou maieſt looke into thy baſenes, and thy owne nothing, and acknowledge that all the good which thou haſt, is from God. This conſideration will gett thee ſubmiſſion of mind, and true humility the mother of all vertues.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therfore waigh with thy ſelfe, the multitude of the ſinnes of thy former life, and namely thoſe ſinnes which thou haſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet thou wert not illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the diuine ſplendour to know God Almightie rightly. Theſe if thou doſt examine with exquiſite diligence, thou wilt finde to bee ſo many in number, that they will exceede the haires of thy head: for in this time thou leadeſt the life of a heathen, ignorant of the diuine powre, and as it were without any knowledge of his ſacred Deity.</p>

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:14984:45"/>
Then conſider how thou haſt behaued thy ſelfe about the tenne commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and the 7. deadly ſinnes, and thou wilt fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that there is no precept of Almightie God, which thou haſt not violated, nor any mortal ſinne, into which thou haſt not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, eyther in thought, word, or deed.

                     <p>Tell mee I pray the, how thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the dayes of thy infancy, thy youth and the flower of thy manly age? how haſt thou employed thy 5. exteriour ſenſes, and inward faculties of thy ſoule, giuen vnto thee by God, only to bee buſied about his holy ſeruice, and the contemplation of heauenly thinges, what haſt thou turned thine eyes vnto, but to beholde vanityes? what haue thine cares liſtned after but lies and tales? what hath thy tongue vttered but mnrmuringes, and blaſphemous ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? what hath thy taſt and feeling bene delighted in, but wanton pleaſures? how haſt thou vſed the remedy of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, giuen vnto thee, as a ſingular gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te? what thankſgiuing haſt thou reſtored for ſoe many benefittes which he hath

                     <p>Thirdly conſider, thoſe ſinnes, which thou haſt euery day committed, after God Almighty hath illuminated and opened the eyes of thy ſoule to meditate vpon heauenly thinges: and thou shalt finde that the old <hi>Adam</hi> hath yet borne a great ſway in thy actions, and that ſinfull roote to haue procreated in the, many and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe habits.</p>
                     <p>Diligently ponder, how vngratefull thou haſt bene to God Almighty, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull

                     <p>Enter into conſideration how rigid thou art to thy neighbour, and how indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to thy ſelfe? how thou loueſt thy owne will, how thou adheareſt to thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, how chary of thy honour, and of euery thing that belongeth vnto thee. Waigh well with thy ſelfe, how euery day thou groweſt more arrogant, more ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, more vaine, more prone to anger, more deſperatly bent to malice, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to delightes and pleaſures, more muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more vnconſtant, more propenſe to carnal ſinnes, and a greater louer of earthly vanities. Conſider thy inconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in good, thy indiſcretion in wordes, imprudence in deedes, in heigh and difficult matters pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity ſometimes, and often audacious temerity.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place, after thou haſt take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notice of the number and order of thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, pauſe vpon them a while in thy min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and waigh euery one in the ballance of

Which if thou doeſt diligently pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, thou wilt finde that thou haſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God, whoſe maieſtie and goodnes is immenſe, who hath obliged man vnto him with ſo many benefites, as there are ſandes in the ſea, or drops of water in the Ocean.</p>
                     <p>Why haſt thou ſinned, or what violent occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath enforced thee to any cryme? a litle momentary pride: a foule repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of pleaſure; ſome ſmale commoditye placed in thy ſight, and oftentimes, no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at all, but euil cuſtome, and mere contempt of God.</p>
                     <p>But alas how haſt thou ſinned? with ſuch facility, with ſuch notable audacity, with ſo litle feare and conſcience, yea with ſuch ſecurity and pleaſure, as though thou hadeſt to doe with no other then a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den God, who regardeth not theſe ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thinges, neyther vnderſtandeth or ſeeth any thing, what is done vpon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the earth. Is this the honour due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſupreme maieſty? is this a remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14984:47"/>of his benefittes? doeſt thou with ſuch ſeruices requite his whippinges, his buffettinges, and pretious bloud sheadd vpon the Croſſe for thy ſake? o wicked wretch that haſt offended ſo great a maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, more miſerable, that for ſo ſleight a cauſe, and moſt deplorable, that thou art not ſenſible of thy vtter Ruine; that after ſinne thou feareſt not damnation, and ſo neglecteſt to doe penance.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer it is very profitable, to inſiſt a while vpon this conſideration, and that thou eſteeme thy ſelfe nothing, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly perſwade thy ſelfe that thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thy ſelfe but ſinne; all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be the giſtes of God Almighties bountie. For it is moſt euident, that all our good, both of grace and nature doth flowe from him: for he is the Author of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of predeſtination (which is the fountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and originall of all others) of the grace of our vocation, of concomitant and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering grace, and of the grace of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. What haſt thou then, that thou canſt boaſt of, but ſinne? only this nothing thou canſt attribute to thy ſelfe, all other things belong to God: Whence thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt clearly and manifeſtly perceaue what he is, and what thou art, and hence come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, what diffidence thou oughteſt to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14984:47"/>haue in thy ſelfe, and what confidence in God; to loue him, and to glorifie thy ſelfe in him, and not in thy ſelfe, but ſo farr as his grace doth freely operate in thee.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thinges being digeſted with atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue meditation, as much as thou canſt, vrge thy ſelfe, to a contempt of thy ſelfe: ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that thou art like an emptie reede shaken with euery blaſt of wind, without grauity, without vertue, without conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without ſtabilytie, and finally without any thing.

Beleeue me, thou hart more abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, before God and his holy Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes. Thinke thy ſelfe vnworthy to lifte vp thine eyes to Heauen; to tread vpon the earth, or that the creatures should ſerue thee; yea not worthy to eat bread or breath in the aire. Caſt thy ſelfe with the ſinfull woman in the Ghoſpel, at our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours feete: preſenting thy ſelfe vnto him with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed and blushing countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, no otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery before her husband, and with inward ſorrowe, and true compunction, begg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of thy ſinnes: that for his infinite

From all theſe foreſaid circumſtances, thou maieſt gather with what anxietie, a wicked man is oppreſſed at the hower of his departure.

The ſtomacke ſwelleth, the ſpeech faileth, the feet beginne to die, the knees wax cold, the noſtrells fall, the eies ſinck, the face waxeth pale, the tongue can no longer performe its office, finally the ſtriuinge of the ſoule goinge out of the body, diſturbeth all the ſenſes, and leaueth them wholly without vigour.</p>

Wherfore it will not be beſide our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as the ſame Doctour in the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſaith) to imagine hell, a horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed CHAOS, a lake vnder the earth, a deepe fyery dungeon, or as a ſpacious citty, darke and terrible, burninge with obſcure and fearfull fire; filled with waylinges, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, weepinge for the inexplicable pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
                     <p>In this miſerable and vnhappie place are two kindes of torments, <hi>poena ſenſus, &amp; poena damni,</hi> the punishment of ſence, and the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of loſſe of God Almightie.</p>
                     <p>Conſider that there is no outward, or inward ſence of the damned, which is not afflicted with a proper torment; for as the damned in all their members and ſences haue offended God, vſinge them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and weapons wherby, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctinge

The eares which were open tolyes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, and other impurities; shall ringe with vnwonted clamours, out-cries and blaſphemies.

The taſt which was glutted with dainty fare, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be tormented with intollerable hunger and thirſt. The tongue which vttered de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions and murmuringes, shall drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the gall of dragons. The wanton which gaue conſent to their brutish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires shalbe frozen with extreame cold and as holy IOB ſaith:<note place="margin">

                     <p>The interiour ſences alſo shall not want their torments, the imagination shalbe tormented with the apprehenſion of preſent paines, the memory with the callinge to minde of fore-paſſed pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, the vnderſtandinge with the feare of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14984:60"/>future greifs, the will with an ineredible hatred and raginge towards God.</p>
                     <p>There as S.

Tell me I pray thee couldeſt thou endure on little moment the leaſt part of al theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? ſurely it would be very greuious, if not intollerable for thee. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will it be to ſuffer this wholl inundation of euils, at one time in all thy members and ſences, externall, and internall, not one or a thouſand nights, but for all eternitie? VVhat ſence, what tongue, what minde of man is able to conceiue or expreſſe theſe thinges?</p>
                     <p>Neither are theſe the greateſt torments the damned ſuffer. There remaineth yet a more greuious, which the diuines doe call the punishment of loſſe, which conſiſteth in the perpetuall priuation of the beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call viſion of God and his Saintes, and of all that glorious and bleſſed Societie. For that is the greateſt torment, that depriueth man of the moſt excellent good. Seeinge therfore that God is that effectuall and cheefeſt good of all goods, to be depriued
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14984:60"/>of him, muſt needs be the greateſt of all euils.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the generall torments of the damned; beſides theſe, there are other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular torments, wherwith euery one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to their ſinnes are afflicted. The proud, the enuious, the couetous, the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and other vitious haue their peculiar torments; the meaſure of paine there, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be proportionable to their pleaſure here, confuſion there proportionable to their glory and preſumption here: pouertie and want, to plenty, hunger and thirſt, to glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie and to former delightes.</p>
                     <p>To all theſe aforeſaid torments, eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is yet to be added, which is as it were the ſeale and key of all the reſt; for if at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, they should haue an end, they were ſome way tollerable.

From this eternitie of torments procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that great hatred wherwith they are ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed againſt God. Hence proceed thoſe horrible blaſphemies and curſes which with their impure mouthes they raile at God, ſayinge.

                     <head>A Meditation for Saterday.</head>
                     <p>THis day thou shalt meditate vpon the glory of the Saintes of God, which may more eagerly inflame thy ſoule, to contemne the vanities of this world, and aſpire to that eternall felicitie.</p>
                     <p>To the end thou mayeſt get a better knowledge and guſt of this ineſtimable glory. Conſider theſe fiue thinges. Firſt the excellency of the place. Secondly the ioy of that ſociety. Thirdly the viſion of God. Forthly the glory of their bodies. Fifthly the compleat perfection of all aboundant good.</p>
                     <p>In the excellency of the place, take notice of the admirable and wonderfull ſpaciouſnes of it; in approued authours thou readeſt, that the leaſt of the fixed ſtarrs of heauen, is bigger then the wholl earth, and ſome of them doe exceede the earth two or three hundred times in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Then caſt vp thine cies to heauen and conſider the innumerable multitude of them in the firmament, and thou shalt ſee a great deale of void ſpace, where many more may be placed, howe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt thou then but be aſtonished at the greatnes of ſo rare a fabricke?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:14984:62"/>
Then conſider the beutie of that place, which no tongue is able to expreſſe, for if God Almighty in this place of banishment and vale of miſerie, hath made many thinges of admirable and comely hue: of what great beuty, and how much odor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doſt thou thinke that place to be: which God would haue to be the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeat of his glory: the Pallace of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: the manſion of the elect, and the Paradiſe of all pleaſure?</p>
                     <p>After the beuty of the place, conſider the Nobilitie of the Inhabitants, whoſe number, ſanctity, riches, and glory, are farr beyound our imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. S. IOHN ſaith the multitude are ſo great that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable. S. DIONYSIVS affirmeth that the multitude of Angels doe farr exceed the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſublunary creatures. Whom S. THOMAS followinge thinketh, that as the heauens by many degrees exceed the bignes of the earth, beinge but as it were a point of them: ſo proportionably the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spirits, therin conteined, doe ſurpaſſe all earthly thinges. VVhat can be thought more admirable? aſſuredly this well pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered would make a man looſe himſelfe in the abyſſe of God Almighties goodnes.</p>
                     <p>Yea without compariſon euery one of theſe bleſſed Spirits is far more beutifull to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14984:62"/>the eie then all this viſible world. O what would it be to contemplate the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible number of ſo rare and glorious Spirits? and to vnderſtand their ſeuerall offices and perfections? how the Angels bringe meſſages? how the Archangels Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter? how the Principalities triumph? how the Powers reioyce? how the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations bare ſway? how the Vertues shine? how the Thrones doe glitter? how the Cherubins doe illuminate? how the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins doe burne with loue? and finally how all with one vnanimous conſent doe prayſe Almighty God.</p>
                     <p>If the conuerſation and fellowship of good men be ſo delightfull, what pleaſure will it be, to be aſſotiated to ſo great a multitude of Saintes? to be conuerſant with the Apoſtles? to talke with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? to diſcourſe with Martyrs? and to enioy the bleſſed familiarity of all the elect? O but what will it be to enioy his preſence whome the morninge ſtarrs doe magnifie? whoſe beutie the ſun and moone admire? before whome the holy Angels and all the celeſtiall Spirits doe proſtrate themſelues. That <hi>ſumum bonum,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good, which in it ſelfe comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all good whatſoeuer, ô what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will the heart of man feale to behold
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14984:63"/>him, who is one and all. Who although he be moſt ſimple without compoſition, yet conteineth in himſelfe the perfections of all thinges created. VVhat can the heart of man deſire greater?</p>
                     <p>If it were ſo much to ſee and heare Kinge SALOMON, that the Queene of SABA cominge from farr remote parts, moued with his great wiſedome, should ſay: <hi>Beati viri tui &amp; beati ſerui tui,</hi>

                     <p>This is the eſſentiall and trueſt glory of the Saints: this is the laſt end and centre of all our wishes. Conſider more-ouer the glory of their bodies, which shalbe beuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with theſe fowre giftes, ſubtilitie, agilitie, impaſſibilitie and claritie. VVhich will be ſo great, that euery one of the elect (as our bleſſed Sauiour ſaith) shall glitter like the ſun in the kingdome of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

If one only ſun doth ſo reioyce and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate this vniuerſe. VVhat doeſt thou thinke, ſo many brighter ſunnes will doe which shall there shine?</p>
                     <p>VVhat should I ſpeake of other ioyes which there shalbe? health without infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: libertie without violence: beutie without deformity: immortalitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption: aboundance without want: reſt without trouble: ſecuritie without feare: riches without pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: ioy without ſorrowe: honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction.

How great was his mercie to thee, that with longanimitie he expected ſo manie yeares? that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thee to ſpend thy dayes in ſo great impuritie of wickednes? that he hath often viſited thee with good and holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations? that he did not cutt of the thred of thy peruerſe life, as he ſerued others in the ſame place?

                     <p>Theſe are the comon benefits.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14984:68"/>of his ſorrowe,<note place="margin">conſidered in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt.</note> that we may compaſſionate with him. Secondly, the greatnes of our ſinnes, which were the cauſe of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that we may abhorr them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the greatnes of the benefit, that we may be gratefull for it. Fourthly, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the diuine charitie and bountie therin manifeſted, that we may loue him more feruently. Fifthly, the conueniencie of the miſterie, that we may be drawne to admiration of it. Laſtly, the multiplicitie of vertues of our bleſſed Sauiour which did shine in this ſtupendious miſterie, that we may partly immitate and partly admire them; wherfore in the middeſt of theſe meditations let vs ſome time compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with our bleſſed Sauiour in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of his ſorrowes, extreame indeed, both by reaſon of the tendernes of his bodie, as alſo for the great affection he bore vnto our ſoules. He did ſuffer them without any manner of conſolation, as we shall ſpeake herafter in its proper place. Sometimes let vs ſtirr vp in our ſelues compunction for our ſinnes, which were the cauſe of theſe his ſo great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes. Sometimes let vs kindle in our ſouls an ardent affection, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his great affection towards vs, which vpon the Croſſe he declared and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14984:69"/>manifeſted to the whole world. And the benefit which he beſtowed vpon vs in his paſſion, becauſe he bought vs with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable price of his precious bloud, of which only we reape the fruite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. Sometimes let vs ruminate vpon the conueniencie of the manner, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wiſdome would he pleaſed to chuſe, to cure our miſeries, to ſatisfie for our ſins, to releeue our neceſſities, to make vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his glorie, to repreſſe our prid, to induce vs to the loue and ioyfull ſufferinge of pouertie, iniuries, auſteritie, and all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable laborious exercices. More-ouer it will not be beſids the matter, to looke into the admirable examples which did principally shine in the life and paſſion of our ſweet Sauiour, his meeknes, patience, obedience, mercie, pouertie, charitie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, bountie, modeſtie, and other his rare vertues, which in all his actions did glitter like ſtarrs in the firmament. And cheifly to this end, let vs meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe thinges, that as neere as we can, we may imitate them. Let vs shake of ſlouth, and eleuate our ſouls, that as much as in our power lyeth with the help of his holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce we may trace his ſacred foot-ſteps. This is the beſt and moſt profitable methode of meditatinge vpon our Bleſſed Sauiours
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14984:69"/>paſſion, that is to ſay, that ther-by we be drawne to imitation, and ſo to be wholly transformed into our Bleſſed Sauiour, that each one may ſay with the Apoſtle: <hi>Viuo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem iam non ego, vi uit vero in me Chriſtus:</hi> And nowe I liue but not I, but CHRIST in me. More-ouer in meditating our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours paſſion, we muſt ſet him before the eies of our ſouls, imageninge that we ſee, as preſent the panges of his heauy ſufferinges; and we muſt not only inſiſt vpon the bare hiſtorie of his paſſion, but we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other circumſtances, namely theſe fower, firſt, who it is that ſuffereth, ſecondly, for whome, thirdly, howe, fourthly, why. Firſt, he that ſuffereth is God, omnipotent, infinite, immenſe. For whome? the moſt vngratefull creature in the world, and leſs regardinge his benefits. Howe? with moſt profound humilitie, charitie, bountie, meeknes, mercie, patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, modeſtie, &amp;c. VVhy? not for his owne commoditie, nor our merits; but for his immenſe pietie, mercie, goodnes and loue towards vs.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, let vs not onely contemplate his outward, but his inward torments, for much more may be conſidered in the ſoule then in the bodie of CHRIST, both for the more ſenſible feelinge of his paſſion there,

O thrice happie Apoſtles, did you not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtand amazed at the ſight of ſo great humilitie? What doſt thou doe PETER? canſt thou permitt the Lord of Maieſtie to wash thy feete? S.

If the flesh, which properly ſuffered not this anguish, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through a ſimple immagination, was thus afflicted, what did his ſoule feale; to whome properly theſe ſorrowes did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine?</p>
                     <p>His prayer beinge ended, that counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait freind of CHRIST <hi>Iudas</hi> the traitour, came atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with a hellish boand; he I ſay which renounced his apoſtleship, to be head and Captaine of a troope of hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, behold in the fore-front of that wicked multitude, impudently cominge to his maſter whome before he had ſolde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying him with a kiſſe of peace and freindship.</p>
                     <p>In that hower ſaied IESVS to the company, which came to apprehend him:

                     </p>
                     <p>This miſterie is worthy of admiration, for what thinge can be more admirable and ſtupendious, then to ſee the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne of God, not only in the forme of ſinfull man, but in the shape of a condemned man: <hi>Haec eſt hor a veſtra, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas tenebrarum:</hi> This is your hower and the power of darkenes. From which wordes, is gathered that this innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lambe, was left to the diabolicall cruelty of the princes of darkenes, who by their vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes and miniſters powred all the malice and miſcheife they were able to conceiue againſt him. Conſider, how much for thy ſake the ſupreme Maieſtie of God is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to endure all the extremitie of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes that euer any ſuffered in this preſent life, not to die for his owne faults but for thy ſins, but he did vndergoe this of his owne accord, to free thee from the power of Sattan.</p>
                     <p>He had skarce ſpoken theſe wordes, when that wholl rabble of hunger-ſtarued wolues, gapinge after their prey, rushed vpon this meeke and innocent lambe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14984:75"/>tearinge and afflictinge him with as much cruelty as euer they could. O bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and inhumane proceedinges? ô cruell and ſauage blowes, contumelious violences, wherwith they tormented him? they inſulted after a horred manner no otherwiſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conquerers retourne loaden with ſpoiles after they haue put to flight their enemies, or hunters when they haue caught their prey. The handes which a little before were exerciſed in workinge miracles, they were nowe bound with ropes ſo cruelly, that they raſed the skin, and beſmeared them with blood. Thus they led him through the publick ſtreetes of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> followinge him with contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies and blowes: behould him in this iournie goinge alone, left by all his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, compaſſed with a multitude of his enemies, forced to make ſuch haſt, that he was wholly out of breath, his colour changed, his face blushinge, and his wholl body weakened and wearied by reaſon of the intollerable preſent difficultie.</p>
                     <p>Although our bleſſed Sauiour was barbarouſly and moſt cruelly handled by that blood-ſuckinge multitude: yet neuer the leſs thou mightſt haue ſeene in his countenance a pleaſant ſweetnes, in his eies a comely grauitie, in his manners a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

                     <head>A Meditation for VVeddenſday.</head>
                     <p>THis day thou shalt conſider, how CHRIST our Lord was offered vp to CAYPHAS the high Preiſt: what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he endured there all that night: how. S. PETER denied him: and laſt of all how cruelly he was ſcourged.</p>
                     <p>Conſider firſt of all, how he was led from the houſe of ANNAS to CAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHAS his houſe, it is worth thy paines to followe him thether. For there thou shalt ſee the mighty ſun of iuſtice ecclypſed: there thou shalt behould, the diuine face vpon which the Angels themſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to gaze, to be deformed with the filthie ſpittinges of the Iewes. For our bleſſed Sauiour ſtandinge in the middeſt of them, was coniured by the high Preiſt in the name of his Father, to ſpeake out, what he was. He anſwered as beſeeming himſelfe: but they who were vnworthy of ſuch an anſwere, blinded with the ſplendour of this great light, like mad dogges rushed vpon him, vometing vp the bitter gaule of their wholl malice againſt him.</p>
                     <p>They began whole troupes of them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> him, to beate and kick him, they ſpit
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14984:76"/>vpon his diuine face, and threwe the verie ſnot of their filthy noſes vpon it. Others hood-winked his eies with a dirty linnen cloath, ſmiteinge him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cheeke, and would in mokerie haue him prophecy who it was that ſtrooke him. O admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vn-heard of patience, and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the only begotten Sonne of God. O the face which the Angels of heauen doe contemplate with incredible ioy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with their ſordid and filthy ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges.</p>
                     <p>Men, when they ſpit, comonly tourne themſelues to ſome foule place, ſome what remote from the ſight of others. In this pallace was there no place found more contemptible therin to caſt their ſpit and filthy dryuell, then the ſacred face of CHRIST IESVS? O man that art but duſt and ashes, canſt thou chooſe but be ſtirred vp to humility, and contempt of thy ſelfe at ſo rare an example?</p>
                     <p>Conſider more-ouer, what tormentes our bleſſed Sauiour ſuffered all that night, how the Officers that kept him, that ſleepe should not cloſe his eies, afflicted him, derided the ſupreme Maieſtie of God, and loaded him with many iniurious contumelies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:14984:77"/>
Waighe with thy ſelfe, my ſoule, that now thy ſpouſe is made the white and mark, receiuing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe all the dartes of iniurious contumelies that the miſchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous Iewes could shute at him. O cruell night, o vnquiet night, in which thou bleſſed IESVS couldeſt reſt no more by reaſon of anguish and affliction, then others who tooke pleaſure to torment the. The night was ordained for the reſt of all creatures, that the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers and ſenſes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the labour of the day before, might then take ſome repoſe. But the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Soldiers that kept thee, ſpent it in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentinge of thy ſenſes, they did bind thy bodie, vexedthy ſoule, fettered thy hands and feete with manicles, buffeted thy cheekes, ſpit vpon thy face, blinded thine eies, ſo that all thy ſenſes when they should haue beene refreshed were afflicted.</p>
                     <p>O! howe farre did theſe mattins differ from thoſe, which at the ſame time the bleſſed Angels did ſinge in heauen? they cried holy, holy: and the Iewes cried he is guiltie of death, crucifie, crucifie him. O angelicall ſpirits which vnderſtood both cries, what could you imagine or thinke whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſawe the inhumane cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wherwith he was handled in earth, whome in heauen you adored with ſo
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14984:77"/>great ſubmiſſion and reuerence? did you not wonder to ſee him ſuffer all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame tormentes for to expiate the ſins of thoſe, who inflicted them vpon him? who hath euer heard of ſuch immenſe charitie, that for this reaſon one should ſuffer death, to heale the greife and cure the woundes of his murtherers?</p>
                     <p>The fall of S. PETER, that great pillar, did not a little increaſe the anxietie of this tedious night; that he, whome he enteirely loued amongſt the reſt whome he choſe to be preſent at his glorious transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to whome he committed the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his holy Church, whome he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be head and Prince of the Apoſtles, that he I ſay, should before his face, and in his preſence denie him, not once but thrice, addinge blaſphemies and oathes, that he knewe not the man. Tell me PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, did this man ſeeme to thee ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and wicked, that in future times thou dideſt feare, it would bee a diſgrace vnto thee to confeſs him now? dideſt thou not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that thou didſt firſt pronounce the ſentence of condemnation againſt him, before he was adiudged by the high Preiſts, when thou dideſt not eſteeme him ſo much as worthy of thy acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment? couldeſt thou doe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14984:78"/>iniury to CHRIST IESVS?</p>
                     <p>But CHRIST ſorrowfull for this great fault of S. PETER turned himſelfe, and caſt his eies vpon him, that with his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious countenance he might reduce this wandering sheepe into the sheepfold of his mercies. O admirable aſpect, ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but full of ſignification, which S. PETER knewe right vvell, and vvell vnderſtood of vvhat force and efficacy it vvas. The trovvinge of the cock had little auailed to his compunction and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had not the countenance of CHRIST our Sauiour bene adioyned. Whoſe eies did ſpeake and vvorke that ſtupendious chaunge, the certainty of vvhich, not only the flovving teares of S. PETER, but of our bleſſed Sauiour himſelfe did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>After all theſe iniuries conſider, vvhat CHRIST did ſuffer, vvhen he vvas bound to be ſcourged at the pillar, for the iudge vvhen he ſavve, that be could not pacifie the fury of thoſe infernall monſters, he thought good to aduiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to beare him vvith roddes and vvhippes. Wherby his vvholl bodie might be torne, hopinge that vvay to molifie their obſtinate and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hearts: that vvhen they ſavve him ſo torne and mangeled, they vvould ceaſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14984:78"/>further to deſire his cruell death.</p>
                     <p>Enter novve my ſoule in ſpirit, into the houſe of PILATE, and haue teares in readines, for thou vvilt haue neede of them, if thou shalt diligently conſider, vvhat vvas done there.</p>

See his ſacred body bound to the pillar vvith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ropes, in ſuch a faſſion that on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide they might haue rome to torture him.</p>

                     <p>Conſider hovv CHRIST the Sauiour of the vvorld, after that extreame cruelty of his tormentours, vvent vp and dovvne the Pallace all torne and cutt, ſeekinge and gathering vp his garmentes, not findinge one amongſt thoſe inhumane raſcalls, that vvould shevv vnto him the leaſt act of humanity, in vvashinge or refreshing his vvoundes, or lend their hand to help him to putt on his cloaths.

What heart, what minde, what ſoule, is able to comprehend the dolour, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgine MARIE then did ſuffer? her heart fainted, and a dead ſweate with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame anguish poſſeſſed her wholl body, and preſently she had giuen vp the ghoſt, had not the diuine diſpenſation reſerued her, till better times, for her greater merite, and more aboundant reward.</p>
                     <p>The bleſſed Virgine, with ſpeed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the ſteps of her beloued Sonne, that ardent deſire wherwith she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to ſee him, added vigour to her, of which ſorrowe had bereaued her: she heard a farr of the noiſe of armes, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people, and the ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, on euery ſide publishing the paſſion of CHRIST, after that she ſawe the glitteringe of launces and holbeards: in the way she found his footſteps ſprincked with drops of blood, by which without any guid or leader she might eaſily find the way.

                     <p>THis day thou shalt meditate vpon the miſterie of the Croſſe, and the ſeauen wordes which CHRIST ſpake vpon it: Rouze vp my ſoule and duely ponder this great miſtery of the Croſſe, which brought fourth the fruite of ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to expiate that great loſſe, which all mankind ſuffered by a tree.</p>
                     <p>Conſider how, before our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour came to the Mount of <hi>Caluarie</hi> (to make his death more ignominious) his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14984:83"/>cruell tormenters ſtripped him of all his cloathes, except his coate, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeame, behould howe patiently this meeke lambe ſuffereth his garmentes to be taken from him, not ſo much as openinge his mouth or ſpeakinge one worde againſt their barbarous dealinge. He permitted theſe thinges willingly, but with a great ſtraine to modeſty. He was ſtripped naked that we might receiue a better garment, to couer the nakednes of our ſins, then that of ADAM the firſt parent of all mankind, made of the leaues of fig-trees to couer the nakednes of his body.</p>
                     <p>Some Doctours thinke that the crowne of thornes was taken of, to pull with more facillitie his vnſeamed garment ouer his eares and after to be faſtened on againe, which could not be without a vehement paine, the sharp thornes did a fresh wound his ſacred head with vnſpeakable torment. And ſurely this is not vnlike, ſeeing in the wholl time of his paſſion they ſpared him in nothinge; but the bittereſt tormentes they could deuiſe, they heaped vpon him, eſpecially when the Euangeliſt ſaith, they did to him whatſoeuer they would. This coate did ſo cleaue to the woundes of his ſacred body, by reaſon of the congealed blood, that when the barbarous hangemen
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14984:83"/>drewe it of with exceeding violence, they renewed againe the woundes of IESVS, they pulled of with it many particles of flesh, ſo that the wholl body of CHRIST, in euery part fleyed and bloody, from the head to the foote ſeemed to be but one entire and continuate wound.</p>
                     <p>Weigh well with thy ſelfe (my ſoule) the immenſe goodnes and mercy of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in theſe tormentes, behould he that ſpreadeth the heauens with cloudes, veſteth the greene and pleaſant feilds with flowers, and he that liberally beſtoweth clothinge vpon euery creature, behould him I ſay ſtarke naked. Conſider what cold, this pretious body, beinge wounded, ſuffered, when they had not only ſpoyled him of his garmentes, but his very skin was not enteire, neither were his woundes bound vp, but expoſed to the iniury of the aire.</p>
                     <p>If S. PETER, being well clothed could not ouercome the cold of the fore-paſſed night: What cold doeſt thou thinke this delicate body ſuffered being in euery place wounded and all naked?</p>
                     <p>Then conſider how CHRIST was faſtened to the Croſſe, and what torment he ſuffered, when the sharp nayles pearced the moſt ſenſible parts of his tender body;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14984:84"/>Weigh with thy ſelfe that the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, which beheld theſe thinges with her eies, and hearing, the frequent blowes of the mallet, which they iterated in driuinge the nayles into the handes and feet of her Sonne, was not vnſenſible, but the heart of the Mother was pearced with the handes and feete of the Sonne.</p>
                     <p>When CHRIST was made faſt vpon the Croſſe, preſently they lifted it vp, and put it into a hole there before prepared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how theſe wicked torterours of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t IESVS pricked forward with their owne malice, lett the heauy Croſſe fall into the hole with ſuch a violence, that it ſo much ſtrained his body hanginge only by the nayles, and rent wider the woundes of his handes and feete.</p>
                     <p>Sweet Sauiour ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there befound a heart ſo hard and ſteely, which is not molified at ſuch a ſpectacle, when the very ſtones did cleaue in ſunder, as ſenſible of thy cruell tormentes?</p>
                     <p>O Lord, the dolours of death compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee round about, the ſtormes and waues of the raginge ſea enuirouned thee on euery ſide.

                     <p>Lord, from theſe vnheard-of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which thou haſt made for my ſins, I cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with all humility the greiuiouſnes of my heinous tranſgreſſion, which were the occaſions of all thy miſeries. I ſee thee my King and God faſtned vpon a wodden Croſſe, with two yron nayles; thy pretious and tender flesh to be ſtretched without any manner of reſpite. If thou wouldeſt a little eaſe thy ſelfe vpon thy feete, the weight of thy wholl body enlargeth their wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: if thou wouldeſt leaue the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, the weight of it doth likewiſe rend their woundes; thy ſacred head could find no reſt becauſe thou hadeſt no other pillowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sharpe crowne of thornes.</p>
                     <p>O virgine Mother howe willingly wouldeſt thou haue embraced him in thine armes, thero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eaſe and reſt himſelfe a little. But the armes of the Croſſe would not permitt the, vpon which, if he would repoſe the sharp thornes ſtrooke deeper into his head: the troubles of the Sonne were much augmented by the preſence
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14984:85"/>of the Mother; which no leſſe crucified his ſoule then the Ievves his body to the Croſſe.</p>
                     <p>O ſvveet IESV, in one day thou dideſt carry a double croſſe, the one vpon thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the other in thy ſoule, the one of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the other of compaſſion, the one pearced thy body vvith nayles of iron, the other thy ſoule vvith nayles of ſorrovve.

                     <p>O barbarous caitifes! ô adamantine heartes! did you thinke thoſe tormentes he ſuffered before his death were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that you would not vouchſafe to ſpare him beinge dead? what madnes did poſſeſſe your ſoules? lift vp your eies and

                     <p>Behould the centurian ſtroock â launce into his ſacred ſide vvith ſuch viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the very Croſſe did tremble, out of whoſe ſide did gush aboundance of blood and water, for the redemption of all mankind.

O gate of heauen, windowe of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, place of reſt, tower of fortitude, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of the iuſt, neaſt of doues, tombe of pilgrimes, flourishinge bed of the ſpouſe!

                     <p>When she ſawe her Sonne in this caſe, what greife, what dolours can we imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine she then did ſuffer?

                     <p>Thus this bleſſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany did mourne, and lament, wateringe with aboundant teares the body of IESVS.

                     <p>The monument was couered with a ſtone, and the face of MARIE obſcured with a cloud of ſorrowe. When there againe she bad her Sonne adue, she then began to be more and more ſenſible of her ſolitude. For then she ſavve her ſelfe, to be depriued of the greateſt good.

                     <p>In the myſtery of our bleſſed Sauiours aſcenſion, firſt conſider that he deferred it for forty dayes, that in the meane time often appearinge to his diſciples, he might inſtruct them, and vvith them diſcourſe of the kingdome of heauen.

Hence vve may note, that thoſe are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten depriued of the corporall preſence of CHRIST, and of ſenſible deuotion, vvho vvith the vvinges of contemplation fly vp to heauen and feare no danger. Wherin the diuine prouidence, vvhervvith it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth &amp; gouerneth the elect, doth vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully manifeſt it ſelfe, hovve it ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the vveake, exerciſeth the ſtronge, giueth milke to little ones, prepareth ſtronger meat for great ones, comforteth ſome, afflicteth others, and to conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodates himſelfe to all accordinge to their ſeuerall degrees in their ſpirituall profitt. Wherfore he that is roborated by diuine comfort, ought therfore not to preſume of him ſelfe, ſeeinge this ſenſible conſolation, is but the meat for infirme ones, and a great ſigne of vveaknes: nor he that is exerciſed by affliction, ought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be deiected, ſeeinge temptation is for the moſt part, a teſtimony of a valiant minde.</p>
                     <p>CHRIST aſcended vp to heauen, in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his diſciples, that they might be vvittneſſes of this myſtery, of vvhich they vvere eie-beholders, none can giue better teſtimony of God almighties deedes, then he vvhich hath learned them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: vvherfore he that vvould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14984:90"/>knowe, how good, howe ſweet, and mercifull he is towardes his, and what is the force and efficacy of his diuine grace, loue, prouidence, and ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: lett him aske thoſe, which indeed haue had experience of them, for they and only they, will giue him the beſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>More-ouer CHRIST would aſcend, his diſciples lookinge vpon him, that they might proſecute him with their eies and ſpirit, that they might haue a cordiall fealinge of his departure: that in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they might feare to remaine alone, and that they might the better diſpoſe themſelues to receiue his holy grace. The Prophet HELISEVS,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.</note> when HE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAS was to be taken and ſeparated from him, deſired that he would giue him his ſpirit, HELIAS made anſwere: <hi>Rem quidem difficilem postulasti, attamenſi videris me, quando tollar àte, erit tibi quod pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſti; Si autem non videris, non erit.</hi> Thou haſt asked a hard thing: neuer the leſſe if thou ſee me when I shall be taken from thee, thou shalt haue what thou haſt asked: but if thou ſee me not, thou shalt not haue it.</p>
                     <p>In like manner they shall be heires of the ſpirit of CHRIST, whome loue
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14984:91"/>doth cauſe to mourne, for his departure: to whome his abſence doth ſeeme greuious, who earneſtly whilſt they liue in this ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, deſire his holy preſence. Such a Sainct was he that ſaied: thou art gon my comfortour, without any care of me, at thy departure thou dideſt bleſſe thine, and I ſawe it not; the Angels promiſed, that thou shouldeſt retourne againe, and I heard them not. Who is able to expreſſe or vnderſtand the ſolitude, trouble, cries and teares of the bleſſed Virgine, of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued diſciple, S.

                     <p>Laſt of all to cloſe vp this meditation, it is left to vs to conſider, with what glory, with what ioy, this noble conquerour was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14984:91"/>brought into that heauenly citty: what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities were then inſtituted in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Paradiſe, howe magnificently was he entertained by thoſe celeſtiall citizens? what a delightfull ſpectacle was it, to ſee men accompanied with Angels, to goe in proceſſion, and to ſett vpon thoſe ſeates, which for many thouſand yeares, were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. But a moſt rauishinge ioy it was, to behold, the ſacred humanity of CHRIST IESVS, farr tranſcending al others, to ſett at the right hand of his eternall Father.</p>
                     <p>All theſe thinges are worthy of thy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue conſideration, that thou maieſt learne, that the labours thou doeſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe for the loue of God, are not ſpent in vaine, therfore he that humbled himſelfe vnder all creatures, it was requiſite that he should be exalted aboue all; that the louers of true glory may trace this path, they muſt expect if they deſire to be aboue all, that firſt they be ſubiect to all, euen their inferiours.</p>

               <p>THESE are the exerciſes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations (Chriſtian Reader) wherwith euery day thou Maieſt feed thy ſoule, which if thou doeſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe, thou wilt neuer want matter, to bueſy thy minde deuoutly. But thou muſt note,<note place="margin">Six partes neceſſary for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> that meditation, if it be well perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ought to conſiſt of ſix partes. Some of which goe before, others followe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer.</p>
               <p>Firſt before we apply our ſelues to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,<note place="margin">Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it is neceſſarie, that our minde and ſoule be diligently prepared to this holy exercice. As the ſtringes of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except they be before-hand well tuned, will neuer make a pleaſant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody.</p>
               <p>After preparation ought to followe the readinge of ſome holy myſtery,<note place="margin">Reading.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the diſtribution of dayes in the weeke, which in younge beginners is cheifely neceſſary vntill with continuall

               <p>Theſe ſix partes are required to mentall prayer, which beſides other comodities they miniſter aboundant matter of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſeeing they ſett be fore vs diuers ſortes of meates, that if one will not relish our ſpirituall taſt, we may fall vpon an other: if we be deficient in one; in an other we may employ our mindes, and kindle our deuotion.</p>
               <p>But in euery meditation, neither all theſe partes nor order is alwayes neceſſary: although, as I ſaid before, to younge begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it is. That they should haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine methode, accordinge to which they are to guide them ſelues, wherfore in that which hath, or shall be ſaid, my intention

               <p>Theſe meditations are called, the one intellectuall, the other immaginarie.

                  <p>AMongſt all documentes this is chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to be obſerued, that when in meditation we cannot preſently perceiue that ſweetnes of deuotion we expect, not therfore to wax puſillanimous, or leaue of from the exerciſe begun, but patiently with longanimity expect the cominge of our lord: ſeeinge it beſeemeth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the diuine Maieſtie: the vility and baſenes of mans condition, the importance of the buſines we haue in hand, to ſtay a while before the gates of his ſacred pallace: If he cometh preſently after a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, with many thankes let vs with gratitude entertaine this vndeſerued fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: If he maketh longer delaies, let vs humble our ſelues before him, and confeſſe that we doe not deſerue this grace: If he vouchſafeth not to come at all, let vs bare it patienthy with a quiete mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues, that we haue offered our ſelues, with all we haue vnto him for a gratefull ſacrifice: that we haue denied our owne proper wills, reſigninge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his Power: that we haue crucified all our inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate appetites: that we haue fought againſt our paſsions and vices. And finally
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14984:108"/>that we haue performed whatſoeuer was in our power to be done. And although we haue not worshiped him with ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deuotion. Yet let it ſuffice vs, if that we haue worshiped him <hi>inſpirit and truth,</hi> as he requireth.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, let vs perſwade our ſelues, that this is the moſt dangerous and chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to be feared rocke of this preſent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation, and place, wher in the true and faithfull ſeruantes of God are tried, and diſtinguished from infidells, from which if we shall depart in ſafety, in all others, we shall haue a proſperous ſucceſſe.</p>

                  <p>THis document not much differeth from the former, which not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge is equally neceſſarie, and this it is, that the ſeruant of god muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe, that he hath felt a little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible guſt from meditation; as many doe, when they haue shed a little dry teare, or felt a little molifyinge of the heart, that they haue attained to the ſcope and end of this exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>But they are farr deceiued, for euen as to make the earth fruitfull one little shewer
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14984:108"/>which alaieth the duſt, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but it muſt haue a great deale of raine throughly ſoke into the rootes of the plantes, before it can giue any hopes of a fruitfull yeare: ſo the aboundance of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall waters, are neceſſarie to our ſoules for to make them bringe fourth the fruit of good workes. Wherfore we are not with out cauſe admoniſhed by ſpirituall men, that we should ſpend as much time as poſſible we can in this holy exerciſe, and it is better to inſiſt ſome longe time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then by fitts. For when the time is short, it wilbe almoſt all conſumed, in quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge the immagination, and recollecting the heart. and it often happeneth, that whilſt we should reape the fruit of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer trouble, meditation is quite broke of.</p>
                  <p>Concerninge the prefixed time for meditation, it ſeemeth to me, what ſoeuer is leſs the two howers, or an hower and halfe, is to little for this exerciſe, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt one hower is ſpent in tuninge the inſtrument of our ſoules, repreſſinge idle and vnprofitable thoughts, and recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctinge the minde from temporall thinges: and ſome time alſo is neceſſarie to ſpend in reapinge the fruit of our prayer in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end.</p>
                  <p>Although I cannot deny, but after ſome
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14984:109"/>pious action the mind is better diſpoſed for meditation: for as dried wood quickly burneth, ſo the mind that is well diſpoſed, is ſooner kindled with this celeſtiall fire.</p>
                  <p>The morninge alſo is the beſt time for meditation, becauſe the mind is then moſt free from fancies, and therfore can with better facillitie apply it ſelf to this holy exerciſe. But who by reaſon of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of outward affaires, cannot ſpend ſo much time, yet at leaſtwiſe let them, with the poore widdowe in the ghoſpell, offerr vp to god the ſmall mite of their ſyncere affection. And no doubt but he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth for all creatures accordinge to their ſeuerall neceſſities, will graciouſly accept it, if their culpable negligence doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the contrarie.</p>

                  <head>The eighth Document.</head>
                  <p>THE laſt Document and of greateſt moment is, in this exerciſe of prayer we muſt ioyne meditation to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeinge one is, as it were a ladder vnto the other: wherfore it is the part of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with diligent attention to conſider and ponderate celeſtiall thinges, firſt one, then an other, that at laſt ſome pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be ſtirred vp in the ſoule, like him that with a ſteele ſtriketh fire out of a flint: but it is the property of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which followeth meditation, to enioy this kindled fire, that is to ſay, to embrace that affection, vvhich vvith much labour he hath ſought and found, in deep ſilence and tranquillitie of ſpirit, not vvith many diſcourſes and ſpeculations of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge, but vvith a pure ſimple relation and eie to veritie, hence a certaine doctour ſaith, that medition doth diſcouſe vvith la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſmall profit, but contemplation vvithout any trouble, and vvith much fruit: the one doth ſeeke, and the other findeth: the one doth chewe, and the other eateth the meate: the one doth reaſon and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the other contemplateth thoſe thinges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he loues and taſteth, and in fine the one is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14984:110"/>the meanes, the other is the end: the one is the way and motion, the other the tearme of the way and end of the action. From theſe thinges which we haue ſaid, that rule or axiome is very frequent amongſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Maſters, which fewe of their ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers doe rightly vnderſtand. That is, <hi>fine adepto media omnia ceſſare.</hi> The end beinge atteined vnto, all meanes doe ceaſe. For example, the mariner reſteth when he hath ariued to his deſired hauen. So he that meditates, when by the meanes of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he shall come to the reſt and ſweet guſt of contemplation, ought to leaue the eragged way of reaſoninge and diſcouſe, contentinge him ſelfe, with the memorie of god almightie alone, whome he may behold as preſent to his ſoule, and quietly enioy that ſweet affection, which he shall vouchſafe to beſtowe vpon him, whether it be of loue, admiration, ioy, or the like, and the reaſon is, becauſe the end of this buſines conſiſteth rather in loue, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the will, then in ſpeculations of the vnderſtandinge. When therfore the will hath captiuated the one, and atteined to the other affection: all reaſoninge and ſpeculations of the vnderſtandinge are to be left: that the ſoule may bend all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to it, without a confuſed wanderinge
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14984:111"/>to the actions of the other powers. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a certaine doctour giueth this counſell to thoſe who perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the fire of diuine loue, that they should quite abolish all other thoughtes and ſpeculations, though neuer ſo ſublime and ſubtile, not that they are euill, but becauſe for the preſent they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a greater good. And this is no other, then after we haue come to the end, to leaue meditation for the loue of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
                  <p>Which we may doe (to ſpeake particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of this matter) in the end of euery exerciſe (that is to ſay) after the petition of diuine loue, as aboue ſaid: and that for too reaſons, firſt becauſe it is ſuppoſed that the labour of the finished exerciſe hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome fruite of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towardes God almighty, as the wiſeman ſaith, <hi>melius est finis orationis, quam principium.</hi> Better is the end of prayer, then the beginninge. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is expedient, that, after labour in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the vnderſtandinge reſt a while, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create it ſelfe in the armes of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Heere let euery one reſiſt what ſoeuer immaginations shall preſent them ſelues vnto his minde, let him ſtill his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, let him faſten his memorie ſtrongly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14984:111"/>vpon god, conſideringe that he is placed in his holy prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But let him not adheare to any particular contemplation of God, but only content himſelfe with that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which faith hath miniſtred vnto him: and to this let him add his will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſeeinge this is only that which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth God, and in which the wholl fruite of meditation conſiſteth. The weake vnderſtandinge is little able to conceiue, or comprehend any thinge of God, but the will can loue him verie much.</p>
                  <p>Let him therfore rouze vp himſelfe from te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall thinges, and let him recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with in himſelfe (that is to ſay) to the centre of his ſoule, where is the liuely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of god, here let him harken attentiuely as though he heard God almightie ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge from a high tutret, or as though he held him faſt being preſent in his ſoule: or as though there were no other perſons in the world, beſides God and him-ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Nay I ſay more, let him quite forget him ſelfe, and thoſe thinges which he doeth: for as one of the ancient holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaith, prayer is then euery way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, when he that prayeth doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that he is before God in prayer. And this is to be done not only in the end of the exerciſe, but in the middeſt and in euerie
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14984:112"/>part of meditation. For as often at this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſleepe shall ſweetly oppreſſe any one (that is to ſay) when the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge is drowned as it were in a ſleepe, (but the will watchinge) let him quietly enioy this delicate meate as longe as it shall laſt.</p>
                  <p>But when it is digeſted, let him retourne againe to meditation, in which we muſt behaue our ſelues like a gardiner, who, when he wattereth a bedd of his garden, after he hath once ſprincled it with water expecteth a while, vntill it be drunke in, then ſprincleth againe, that at laſt it may throughly wett the earth, That it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fruitefull. But what the ſoule caſt into this heauenly ſleepe, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the ſplendour of this eternall light, doth enioy! what ſacietie, what chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what internall peace! no tongue is able to expreſſe: this is that peace which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all vnderſtandinge, this is that felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, a greater then which cannot be imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in this vale of miſerie: there are many ſo inflamed with this fire of diuine loue, that their interiours, at the verie memory of this bleſſed name without any medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all before, doe reſt in ioy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe need no more conſideration or diſcourſes, to loue god, then a mother nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14984:112"/>motiues to loue her child, or the bride her husband. Others there are ſo abſorped in God, not only in prayer, but alſo in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward buſines, that they wholly forget the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and all creatures for the loue of him. neither are theſe effects of diuine loue to be admired, ſeeinge worldly loue cauſeth often times greater matters in the mindes of men, that it makes them madd. What shall we attribute leſſe efficacie to grace then vnto nature and ſin? When therfore the ſoule shall feale this operation of diuine loue, in what part of prayer ſoeuer it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, let him neuer refuſe it, although he ſpend all the time of this exerciſe in it without any manner of conſideration at all of that point, he purpoſed to meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (except he be ſpecially obliged vnto it.) For as ſaint AVGVSTINE ſaith vocall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought to be left, if it hurteth deuotion, ſo meditation ought to be differred if it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth contemplation. But as it is neceſſarie to leaue meditation for this affection, and to aſcend from the leſſer to the greater: ſo often times this contemplation is to be left for meditation, when it is ſo vehement, that the corporall health, receiueth ſome domage therby. This oftentimes happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to thoſe who taken with the pleaſure of this diuine ſweetnes, giue them ſelues
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14984:113"/>too indiſcreetly to theſe exerciſes, and vſe them too immoderately, to whome (as a certaine Doctour ſaith) this vvilbe the beſt remedy, that they deſiſt from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tourninge their mindes to ſome other good affection, as of compaſſion in meditatinge of the ſufferinges of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.

But if that be wantinge, nothinge more hard, nothinge more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, nothinge more burthenſome then to pray. Wherfore ſeeing we haue already ſpoken of prayer, meditation, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode to performe it. Nowe it will not be beſides our purpoſe to treate of thoſe thinges which partly promote, and partly hinder and extinguish deuotion in the mind of man. As alſo to lay open the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations which are obuious to thoſe who frequent theſe pious exerciſes, and laſt of all to annex ſome certaine documentes, vvhich may not a little auaile to the vvell performance of this buſines. We vvill therfore beginne from the definition of deuotion: that it may manifeſtly appeare vvhat a pretious margarite it is, for vvhich vve vvarr.</p>
               <p>Deuotion, as S. THOMAS ſaith, is a vertue vvhich maketh a man prompt and readie to euerie vertuous deed, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe him vp to doe vvell. vvhich defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euidently shevveth the neceſſitie and vtilitie of this vertue, as conteininge more in it, then any man can immagine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:14984:114"/>
For the better vnderſtandinge of this, vve muſt knovve, that the cheifeſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment that hindereth vs from leadinge a vertuous life, is the corruption of humane nature, proceedinge from ſinne, vvhich bringes vvith it a vehement inclination to vice, and a great difficultie to doe vvell; this make the vvay of vertue cragged and troubleſome, although in it ſelfe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nothinge in this vvorld, is ſo ſvveet, ſo louely, ſo beautifull.</p>
               <p>The diuine wiſedome hath ordeined the help of deuotion, as a moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient remedie to ouer-come this difficultie: for as the north wind diſſipateth clouds, and maketh a cleare skey, ſo true deuotion expelleth from the mind, the tediouſnes of this way, and maketh vs with alacritie prompt to pious actions. This vertue doth ſo farr forth obteine the name of vertue, that likevviſe it a ſpeciall gift of the holy ghoſt; a heauenly devve, an aſſiſtance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by prayer, vvhoſe property is to remoue all difficulties happeninge in prayer and meditation: to expell tepidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: to miniſter alacritie in the diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to inſtruct the vnderſtandinge: to ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate the vvill: to kindle in our heartes heauenly loue: to extinguish the flames of vnlavvfull deſires: to ingendre a hatred
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14984:115"/>and loathinge of ſinne and all tranſitorie thinges: and laſt of all to him that poſſeſſeth it, to infuſe a newe feruour, a newe ſpirit, a newe mind, and newe deſires to doe well. For as SAMPSON as longe as he had his haire, did exceede all men in ſtrength: but when that was cutt he was as weake as others. So the ſoule of euerie Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with the help of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is ſtronge and valiant. But when it is depriued of it, it becometh infirme and weake.</p>
               <p>But aboue all the prayſes, which can be heaped vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this vertue, this is the cheifeſt, that although it be but one only vertue, yet it is a prick and motiue to all: they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that deſire, to walke in a vertuous way muſt get this for a ſpurr, for without it, he will neuer be able to rule his rebellious flesh.</p>
               <p>Hence it manifeſtly appeareth, in what the true eſſence of deuotion doth conſiſt, not in tendernes of heart, or aboundance of conſolations wherwith they which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate are often recreated except a prompt alacritie of the mind to doe well be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto adioyned:<note place="margin">In vvhat deuotion conſiſteth.</note> eſpecially ſeeinge it ſome times happeneth, the one to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, God almightie ſo diſpoſinge for the triall of his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Though I can not denie. But that theſe conſolations doe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14984:115"/>often proceed from deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the minde to doe well, and on the contrarie, that true deuotion is not a little augmented by the ſame conſolations and ſpirituall guſts. And therfore the ſeruantes of God may lawfully deſire and aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not for the delight they bringe with them, but becauſe they doe greatly increaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion which maketh vs with alacritie to apply our ſelues to vertuous actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which the Kingly Prophet teſtifieth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayinge: <hi>Viam mandatorum tuorum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curri, cum dilatasti cor meum:</hi> I haue runne the wayes of thy commandementes when thou haſt enlarged my heart, that is, when thou haſt recreated me with the ſweetnes of thy conſolations which are the cauſe of this my readines.</p>
               <p>Now let vs treat of the meanes, wherby this vertue is to be atteined vnto, which will bringe no ſmall profit with it, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge it is the ſpurr to all other vertues, to ſet downe the meanes, wherby it is to be obteined, is no other thinge then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſribe the meanes to get all other vertues.</p>

We muſt therfore knowe that ſince to communicate with God almightie of it ſelfe is moſt delightfull, hauinge no bitternes mixed with it, as the wiſe man teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth: hence it cometh to paſſe that many allured with the pleaſure of this admirable and vnuſed ſweetnes (which is greater then can be comprehended) come to God and frequent theſe ſpirituall actions,<note place="margin">The errour and abuſe of ſome.</note> as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, prayer, meditation, vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

This is a great errour and many are plunged in it, for ſeeinge to loue and ſeeke God should be the cheifeſt end of all our actions, theſe loue and ſeeke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that is to ſay, their owne guſt and ſenſible delight, rather then God, which was the ſcope of the contemplatiue Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie of the gentills.

From this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſpringeth an other braunch.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14984:126"/>better liue and raigne in vs. Seeinge both theſe are directly contrarie the one to the other. But this noble victorie ſeeing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obteined vvithout ſpeciall fauour and allurementes of God, therfore vve ought to frequent the exerciſe of prayer, the better by it (and indeed the only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) to obteine this grace, and to bringe this ſerious buſines of our ſoules perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a good and deſired end. With this intention vve may confidently deſire of God internall conſolations, as vve haue ſaied before. This did the Prophet DAVID vvhen he ſaied: <hi>Redde mihi Domine laetitiam ſalutaris tui, &amp; ſpiritu priucipali confirma me:</hi> Giue me, ô Lord, the ioy of thy ſaluation, and confirme me with thy principall ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is manifeſt, what end euerie one ought to prefix to himſelfe in theſe exerciſes, and howe they should eſteeme and meaſure their owne and others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt: not accordinge to the multitude of flowinge conſolations. But accordinge to thoſe thinges they haue conſtantly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for God, partly in fulfillinge his diuine pleaſure, partly in renouncinge their owne proper wills.</p>
                  <p>And that this ought to be the end of all our prayer and readinge it appeareth by that one Pſalme of the Prophet DAVID
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14984:127"/>which beginneth: <hi>Beati immaculati in via, qui ambulant in lege Domini:</hi> Bleſted are the immaculate in the way, which walke in the lawe of our Lord.

Which the holy Ghoſt hath ſo ordeined, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may learne to direct all prayer, and readinge to this end and ſcope. From which they that doe decline, doe caſt themſelues into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſnares of the enemy, who with his ſuttle craft perſwadeth them that, that is ſome great matter which indeed is nothinge, and for this cauſe men moſt exerciſed in ſpirituall matters doe affirme, the only touchſtone of true vertue to be, not that ſenſible delight which is founde in prayer: but patience in affliction, abnegation of ones owne ſelfe, a ſyncere and enteire full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillinge of the diuine will, and finally in a diligent obſeruinge of God almighties lawes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, though I muſt confeſs that prayer it ſelfe, and the freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that are founde therin, doe not a little conduce and help to the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectinge of theſe thinges fore mentioned.</p>
